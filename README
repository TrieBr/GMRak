TO BUILD:


WIN32 DLL:
Open the Visual studio solution in the Win32DLL directory and build DLL file.


Android:

First we need to build the C++ files (RakNet plus the JNI interface). In order to do this, go into raknet-ndk-lib directory and run ndk-build (from the Android ndk).
This will produce .so library files in the raknet-ndk-lib/libs directory.
Copy the contents of the "raknet-ndk-lib/libs" directory to "RakExtension.gmx/extensions/GMRak/AndroidSource/libs" directory.

When a new function is added:
Add the function in the GMInterface, and make sure it works correctly on Windows.
Next we have to make the Java JNI C++ code to interface with it (raknet-ndk-lib/jni/RakNetJNIWrapper.h and raknet-ndk-lib/jni/RakNetJNIWrapper.cpp)
Next, Add the JNI native function definition in RakExtension.gmx/extensions/GMRak/AndroidSource/Java/RakNetJNIWrapper.java
Next, add tge code in RakExtension.gmx/extensions/GMRak/AndroidSource/Java/RakNet.java which calls the native function definition in RakNetJNIWrapper.java.
Re-Build as per instructions above.
